# Basics

Notes on my golang learning process on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-go) and various different sources.

## Introduction

- Go sits in the middle between low-level languages and high-level languages, often offering the advantages of both.
- Go has garbage collection

## Compiling

- For build go files
    
    ```bash
    go build yourfile.go
    ```

    Go is compiled language. After go code compiled an executable file is generated by compiler.

- For execute go executable from bash

    ```bash
    ./greet
    ```

- For build and execute at the same time

     ```bash
    go run yourfile.go
    ```

    Unlike go build, go run will NOT create an executable file in our current folder. Files runs from cache.

## Code Structure

    ```go
    // Package declaration 
    package main 
    
    //Import statement
    import "fmt" 
    
    //Main function
    func main () {
    fmt.Println("Hello World") 
    } 
    ```

    - Package Declaration
        This line tells go which package is '.go' file belongs. 

    - Import Statement

## Packages

- Nice articles about go packages:
