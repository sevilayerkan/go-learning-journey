# Basics

Notes on my golang learning process on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-go) and various different sources.

## Introduction

- Go sits in the middle between low-level languages and high-level languages, often offering the advantages of both.
- Go has garbage collection

## Compiling

- For build go files
    
    ```bash
    go build yourfile.go
    ```

    Go is compiled language. After go code compiled an executable file is generated by compiler.

- For execute go executable from bash

    ```bash
    ./greet
    ```

- For build and execute at the same time

     ```bash
    go run yourfile.go
    ```

    Unlike go build, go run will NOT create an executable file in our current folder. Files runs from cache.

## Code Structure

    ```go
    // Package declaration 
    package main 
    
    //Import statement
    import "fmt" 
    
    //Main function
    func main () {
        fmt.Println("Hello World") 
    } 
    ```

- Package Declaration
    This line tells go which package is '.go' file belongs. 

- Import Statement

## Packages

- Nice articles about go packages:
    1. https://dave.cheney.net/2014/12/01/five-suggestions-for-setting-up-a-go-project

    2. https://www.callicoder.com/golang-packages/

### Using multiple packages

```go
import (
  "package1"
  "package2"
)
```

- For adding alias to package

```go
import (
  p1 "package1"
  "package2"
)
```

## fmt Package

- Implements formatted I/O with functions like C's printf and scanf

Format words : 

- %b -> binary base 2
- %d -> decimal, int, uint
- %o -> octal 
- %x -> base 16, with lower-case letters for a-f
- %g -> float32
- %s -> string
- %p -> pointer
- %t -> boolean

## Comments

- // for single line comments
- /* */ for multi line comments

## Aritmetic Operators

- '+' to add
- '-' to subtract
- '*' to multiply
- / to divide
- % to take the remainder (the modulus operator) between two numbers.

## Variables

```go
var kilometersToMars int32 = 6210000

var variableName string
var stationName string
var nextTrainTime int8
var isUptownTrain bool

var kilometersToMars int32
//Assigning a value to a variable
kilometersToMars = 62100000

var kilometersToMars int32 = 6210000
```

**Constants** 

```const earthsGravity = 9.80665```

**Zero Values**

- All numeric variables have a value of 0 before assignment. String variables have a default value of "", which is also known as the empty string because it contains no characters. Boolean variables have a default value of false.

### Updating Values
```go
var basketTotal float64
spinachPrice := 1.50
basketTotal += spinachPrice
```

### Multiple Variable Declaration
```go
var part1, part2 string
part1 = "To be..."
part2 = "Not to be..."

quote, fact := "Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica", true
```

 
basketTotal = basketTotal + carrotPrice
fmt.Println(basketTotal) // Prints: 0.75

### Inferring Type
- For declare a variable without explicitly stating its type

```nuclearMeltdownOccurring := true```

- := is used to infer type and create a new variable.

- Floats created in this way are of type float64. Integers created in this way are either int32 or int64

## Strings

```go
//String concatenation
description = nameOfSong + " is by: " + nameOfArtist + "."
```
